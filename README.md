NAS Defender Registry
=======


This is being built to fill a need in the Defender community for a centralized location for information pertaining to the ~500 NAS Defender 110's in existence. 

It is being built with the intention of exanding to include all NAS Defender 90's as well, but that will happen when deemed necessary. I'm starting with the basic functionality for now.

Initial Feature Set (for 'launch')
-----------

+ Sightings displayed on a map and associated to vehicles
+ Ability for owners to claim their vehicle (most likely to be moderated)
+ Allow owners to decide whether they would like people to find contact information
+ General public ability to submit For Sale advertisement they find online to the registry and associate them with individual vehicles

Eventual Goals
------------

+ Build on Charles Galpin's work on nas110.com to be able to add technical articles (most likely wiki form)
